My name is Luiz Fernando and I'm a **Computer Science** undergraduate student at the **University of SÃ£o Paulo** (Brazil), having previously studied **Physics** at the same university from 2018 to 2020.

My interests range from Computational Physics to Statistical Learning Theory, Natural Language Processing and Reinforcement Learning.

I am currently working on the project **Integrating multi-agent systems for land use and transport with artificial city generation** (undergraduate research). Previous works include participating in the development of the information retrieval model for the legal documents search engine **Ulysses** for the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies.
